# Metacraft Soldiity Challenge

## Solidity Challenge
- Create a crowdfunding campaign where users can pledge funds to and claim funds from the contract.

## Your contract(s) should be written such that:

1. Funds take the form of a custom ERC20 token
2. Crowdfunded projects have a funding goal
3. When a funding goal is not met, customers are be able to get a refund of their pledged funds
4. dApps using the contract can observe state changes in transaction logs
5. Optional bonus: contract is upgradeable

## Project Requirements - there are two requirements for the challenge:

- Submit your project on GitHub as a public repository that we can run locally, preferably using truffle, ganache, and hardhat.
If you prefer to use different tools, provide explicit instructions to get the contract up and running locally. We should be able to open the provided repository in VSCode and get the contract running locally within a few minutes.

- Record a video of 5 min or less. Loom is a free online tool you could use. In the video, you will do a code walk-through where you share your screen and explain the code. In the code walk-through, run your code and explain the resulting output.

## Your project must provide the following to be successfully completed:

### Functionality and Explanation:
